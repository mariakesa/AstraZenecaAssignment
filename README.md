# AstraZenecaAssignment

This is a repository for a small project that I did as a part of AstraZeneca recruitment for a data scientist position.

app.py contains a Streamlit application for exploring aspects of openFDA data on medications and adverse reactions (25100 cases).

To run the code first pip install pandas, matplotlib, wordcloud and streamlit. 

Then navigate to the folder of this cloned project via command line and type 'streamlit run app.py'. This will run the interactive
data visualizations. 

To further show off my skills Wrangling.ipynb contains preprocessing of the data and SparkSQLForDataAnalysis.ipynb shows some queries that I wrote.

Logistic regression and NaiveBayes classifier are used to predict deaths on features made of medications and symptoms with 82% and 82% accuracy in LogisticRegressionAndNaiveBayes notebook. .
